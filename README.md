This is the utility library I wrote as I was learning Common Lisp. I use it in all my projects, and it evolves as I require new utilities.

Most functions should work pretty well on SBCL and ABCL, which are the two implementations I use regularly. There is code specific to other implementations, but it has never been tested.

There is a test suite (tests.lisp), based on my test library (cleanser), that should cover most of the code.
